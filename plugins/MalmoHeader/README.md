# MalmoHeader

The City of Malm√∂'s masthead contained as a plugin, so that we can easily add or remove this functionality. This only thing this plugins does it to add some external js and css and adapts the position of some affected elements, as well as CSS which gets messed up due to the resources used by the masthead.
