# L.Control.LayerSwitcher

A fairly advanced layer switcher:
- Both baselayers (radiobutton type) and overlays (checkbox type)
- Responsive design and interaction (click and touch events)
- Hidden on small screens with a toggle button
- Can also be toggled on large screens using a top button
- Allows for any number of sub-categories (until a practical limitâ€¦)
- Info button toggling a bootstrap modal (e.g. for metadata)
